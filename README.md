# Fokas Worldgen
Worldgen stuff of mine.

*Didn't expect that, did you?*

# Downloading Dev Builds
Everything outside of *Release* tab is considered as _dev stuff_.

In order to download the dev builds, do this:

1. Download the Repo (save it as a `.zip`, `tar.gz` is for **Linux only!**)
2. Unpack the downloaded file
3. Head to `Fokas-Worldgen-main`
4. Now this part gets tricky, bcs what you want to do, is select which dev build you want to get:
    - For **FokaStudio's Ender Expansion**, go into `far-end-fork` folder
    - For **Foka's Worldgen**, head to `fokas-worldgen`
    - For **Nether 3.0**, go into  `nether-3.0`
    - For ***The Hallow***, go into `the-hallow`
5. Zip the contents of the folder you are in
    - You can double check if you have done that correctly by opening the `zip` and looking for `pack.mcmeta` file. If it is not present, **repeat Step 4.**
6. Drop the newly made `zip` into your respective `datapacks` folder
